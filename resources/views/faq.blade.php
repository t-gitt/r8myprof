                    	To calculate the overall score we only take into consideration the professor's ratings (character, teaching methods, and course mastery) as they are related to professors' performance. Moreover, from our consultation with academics at IIUM and other universities, we assigned a weight value for each rating as follows:
                    </p>
                    <table>
                    	<thead>

                    			<th>Rating   </th>
                    			<th>Weight</th>
                    		</tr>
                    	</thead>
                    	<tbody >
                    		<tr>

                    			<td>Teaching Methods</td>
                    			<td style="text-align:center;color:#9A073C;">40%</td>
                    		</tr>
                    		<tr>

                    <p>
                    	Then, after calculating weight average for each rating, we calculate the average of their sum and use it as our overall score.
